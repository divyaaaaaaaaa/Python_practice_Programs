                                                       How Do You Declare Variables and What Are Naming Conventions to Name Variables?
 To declare variables in Python, you assign a value to an identifier with the assignment (=) operator.
 When naming variables in Python, there are some important rules you should keep in mind:

   Variable names can only start with a letter or an underscore (_), not a number.
   Variable names can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (_).
   Variable names are case-sensitive — age, Age, and AGE are all considered unique.
   Variable names cannot be one of Python's reserved keywords such as if, class, or def.
If you break any of those rules, your Python program will throw a SyntaxError:

 some common naming conventions for variables in Python.
First, variables names should be in lowercase, with separate words separated by an underscore. This is called snake case:my_variable_name = 'freeCodeCamp'
For example, if you want to save a user's age as a variable, user_age is better than age or an abbreviation like ua:
user_age = 30
This way, you can easily communicate the purpose of a variable to other team members (or to your future self) in a large codebase.
Another convention is to avoid using single-letter variable names. This is very common in Python, but should be avoided because variable names with a single letter communicate no purpose or meaning:

x = 56 # What do you mean by x?
This is different if you are in a loop or something similar, as variable names like i, j, k, and so on are common and acceptable.
